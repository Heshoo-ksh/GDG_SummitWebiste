Since joining, I've secured numerous sold-out exhibitions and sold over 150 works. My pieces have created an inventive demand for collectors to purchase more emergent work. In 2024, I was awarded the Gucci Changemakers Siren Art Wall and commissioned to be part of the University of Michigan’s permanent collection. I engage with my community by collaborating, collecting, and curating other artists' work.",
