I have had the honor of teaching within the local public school system DPSCD, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan, and Apple Education, and have had students from all over Detroit and the Metro-area attend my courses.

As an entrepreneur working within the tech-industry, I see many cutting-edge breakthroughs happening on a daily basis; many of which have the potential to change how we live and interact with the world around us. What I have not seen much of is how we are preparing our youth (specifically within Detroit) how to take advantage of these technologies so that they aren't left behind. It has become my prerogative to teach these digital literacy skills to more young people throughout Detroit and the surrounding area to better equip them for their careers ahead.

I have a team of developers that work alongside me to maintain projects for local businesses, design solutions, provide analytical data for storytelling, and teach each of these skills to our youth. I am hopeful that I will be given an opportunity to work alongside some of the awesome vendors listed above and help to edify our youth.`,

Most user personas end up as idealized profiles collecting dust. This hands-on workshop shows you how to transform static personas into dynamic tools that drive real results. You'll learn how to craft positioning and messaging that deeply resonates with each specific persona, turning abstract audience understanding into concrete business outcomes.

Key Takeaways:
• Transform traditional personas into actionable tools for business growth
• Master the three essential personas: the check writer, the champion, and the end user
• Develop precise positioning that addresses your audience's core needs and goals
• Create a messaging framework that maps directly to buying signals, improving engagement and
conversion rates

Session Format:
This interactive workshop combines focused presentation with real-time exercises. Participants will work on their own persona development and messaging strategies, leaving with a practical framework they can implement immediately.

Why It Matters:
Even exceptional products fail when they don't connect with their audience. This session bridges that gap by teaching you how to create messaging that's both deeply relevant and distinctly yours. You'll gain the tools to craft communications that build trust, drive action, and set your brand apart in today's competitive landscape.`,
