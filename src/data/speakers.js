I have had the honor of teaching within the local public school system DPSCD, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan, and Apple Education, and have had students from all over Detroit and the Metro-area attend my courses.

As an entrepreneur working within the tech-industry, I see many cutting-edge breakthroughs happening on a daily basis; many of which have the potential to change how we live and interact with the world around us. What I have not seen much of is how we are preparing our youth (specifically within Detroit) how to take advantage of these technologies so that they aren't left behind. It has become my prerogative to teach these digital literacy skills to more young people throughout Detroit and the surrounding area to better equip them for their careers ahead.

I have a team of developers that work alongside me to maintain projects for local businesses, design solutions, provide analytical data for storytelling, and teach each of these skills to our youth. I am hopeful that I will be given an opportunity to work alongside some of the awesome vendors listed above and help to edify our youth.`,
