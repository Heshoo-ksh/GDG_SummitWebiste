However, the introduction of AI-driven code generation also brings significant security implications that cannot be overlooked. This talk will explore the dual-edged nature of AI in SDLC, examining both the benefits and risks.\nThis session will begin by discussing how AI tools can enhance security by automating vulnerability scanning, identifying security flaws earlier in the development process, and generating secure code with reduced human error. At the same time, we will address the challenges AI presents, including the potential for introducing new vulnerabilities, lack of accountability in automated decision-making, and the risks of over-reliance on AI-generated code without sufficient human oversight.\nThrough real-world examples and use cases, this session will highlight best practices for integrating AI into secure development workflows. It will also cover strategies for mitigating risks and ensuring that AI-driven development remains aligned with robust security principles throughout the SDLC. Attendees will gain insights into the future of secure AI-driven automation and actionable steps to safeguard their development processes.',

        "Legacy applications built with ASP.NET can take a long time to migrate. Doing this work all at once isn't very agile, so in this session we'll explore using YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy), .NET Upgrade Assistant, and the \"Strangler Fig\" pattern to incrementally migrate your legacy ASP.NET applications to modern technologies like ASP.NET Core.\nWhile it might have a funny name, YARP is a very serious tool when it comes to helping you upgrade your legacy ASP.NET projects to ASP.NET Core. The best part is, it helps you do the upgrade gradually and with minimal impact to your users. When done with the help of the .NET Upgrade Assistant, you can also kick off the process without breaking a sweat.\nYou'll walk away more knowledgeable about these tools that help you with your migrations, and learn some of the shims that are available to make certain cross-cutting concerns easier to integrate between your legacy and modern applications. If you might have a legacy migration in your future, you're going to want to join us for this!",
